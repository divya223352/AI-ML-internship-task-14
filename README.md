Understanding the Code
​The Metrics Explained
​When you look at the comparison table, here is what those numbers actually mean in a business context:
​Accuracy: Overall "correctness." Useful if classes are balanced.
​Precision: "Of all predicted positives, how many were actually positive?" (Important if the cost of a False Positive is high).
​Recall: "Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?" (Critical for medical/fraud cases where missing a case is dangerous).
​F1-Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It's the best "all-rounder" metric.
​Why compare multiple models?
​No single algorithm is a "silver bullet." A Decision Tree might be highly interpretable but prone to overfitting, while a Random Forest is more robust but acts like a "black box." By comparing them, you find the sweet spot between complexity and accuracy for your specific data.
​Model Generalization
​The script uses a train_test_split. If your model gets 100% accuracy on training data but only 70% on test data, it has failed to generalize (this is Overfitting). We save the model that performs consistently well on the unseen test data.
In the code, I used StandardScaler. This is vital for SVM and Logistic Regression. These models calculate distances between points. If one feature is "Age" (0–100) and another is "Annual Income" (0–1,000,000), the Income feature will dominate the math simply because the numbers are bigger. Scaling puts everything on a level playing field (usually between -3 and 3).
Best Model Selection (The "Business Requirement")
The task asks you to select a model based on business requirements.
Requirement: High Interpretability? Choose Logistic Regression or a Decision Tree (you can explain why it made a choice).
Requirement: Maximum Accuracy? Choose Random Forest or SVM (more complex, but usually more accurate).
📁 GitHub Submission Structure
Since your guidelines require a GitHub repo, here is the structure I recommend:
main.py: The Python script provided previously.
best_model.pkl: The saved model file generated by the code.
requirements.txt: List the libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, joblib).
README.md: Explain the dataset used, show the comparison table, and justify why you picked your "Best Model."
